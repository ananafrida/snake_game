# snake_game
Snake game -> feed, grow, and score. At first only the up, down, right, and left arrow keys could move the snake. However, my keyboard's keys weren't working. So, I decided to add WSAD keys as moves too :P
Instructions:
W or up arrow -> move up
S or down arrow -> move down
A or left arrow -> move left
D or up arrow -> move right
Green block -> food
Blue Block -> snake
